- 👋 Hi, I’m @GuOCoelho
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a developer, being able to participate in projects around the world regardless on my current country.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Python, by following the 100 Days of Code Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for the moment, but certainly it will come
